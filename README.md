## HYDROSIM_PROJECT
In this project  I simulate 1D hydrodynamic flow using the Saint Venant Equations. The model includes: Boundary Conditions (Dam/Levees), Rainfall Runoff Simulation and 3D Visualizations


## Features

- Set Simulation Parameters via Streamlit UI

- Real-time Visualization (2D and 3D)

- Flood Event Simulation

- Data Export to CSV/Excel

## Built With üî®

- Streamlit
- Python
- Git & Github

## Live Demo (if available)
Live Demo [Link](https://hydro-sim-project1.onrender.com/)


## Install

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

- Open terminal
- Clone this project by the command:
- $ git clone git@github.com:EngruugbeJimmy/Opolo_Conference_Webpage.git

Then go to the main folder using the next command:
- $ cd Portfolio-setup-and-mobile-version-skeleton.git

Finally, run diplay the app.py file in your local browser, or also, you can use Live Server in Visual Studio Code.

## Prerequisites
- IDE to edit and run the code (We use Visual Studio Code üî•).
- Git to versionning your work.

## Usage
- For anyone who wants to practice hydraulic modeling
- For anyone who wants to create his own portfolio.
## How to Use GUI

Open the app using the streamlit run app.py command.

Set the parameters such as domain length, rainfall intensity, and simulation time.

Click Run Simulation.

Visualize the water flow in both 2D and 3D.
